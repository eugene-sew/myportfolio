          We added a navbar,a responsive navbar to our portfolio website we've been buliding based on the learn by doing structure, we incoporated Javascript into this peice, the use of Javascript to do this was quite new to us so there was a little bit of confusion here and there but as budding developers we had to learn the art of debuging and that is exactly what we did today.
          <ul>using the javascript to manipulate the DOM
            <li>Declare variables that get elements from the DOM</li>
            <li>Write your functions to enable interaction with the DOM </li>
            <li>Call the functon to activate the js script</li> 
            you can find this project here <a href="./index.html">Click here...</a>

          Today we had a deep dive into Javascript DOM, where we created a todo application that used javasacript as its logic for working, we worked with the knowledge we had from earlier lessons which are the variable declarations,eventListeners and functions. we used all these knowledge to manipulate the DOM and finally came oout with a work app.we further styled the app using HTML
